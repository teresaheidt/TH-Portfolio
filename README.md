## Goals
As an SMU bootcamp student who is getting a certificate in Full Stack Web Developement, I hope to find opportunites as a web developer. 

## Projects
The projects I have linked in my portfolio are; an application to an application called Middle Point, a weather dashboard, password generator and a daily scheduler.
* **Middle Point** - this is an app that allows the user to find the middle point between two locations.
* **Weather Dashboard** - the user can find out what the weather is in any city across America.
* **Password Generator** - a password wil be generated with random letters, numbers and symbols. 
* **Daily Scheduler** - manage a daily calendar that tells you where the user is in the day with color blocking and provides the current date at the top of the page. 

## Applications used
To build my portfolio, I used w3-schools template, html, css, font awesome for styling and javascript.
